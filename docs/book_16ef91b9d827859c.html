Advertising no longer works. Weaned on TiVo, the Internet, and other emerging technologies, the short-attention-span generation has become immune to marketing. Consumers are â€œin control.â€ Or so weâ€™re told.In Buying In, New York Times Magazine â€œConsumedâ€ columnist Rob Walker argues that this accepted wisdom misses a much more important and lasting cultural shift. As technology has created avenues for advertising anywhere and everywhere, people are embracing brands more than ever beforeâ€“creating brands of their own and participating in marketing campaigns for their favorite brands in unprecedented ways. Increasingly, motivated consumers are pitching in to spread the gospel virally, whether by creating Internet video ads for Converse All Stars or becoming word-of-mouth â€œagentsâ€ touting products to friends and family on behalf of huge corporations. In the process, theyâ€“weâ€“have begun to funnel cultural, political, and community activities through connections with brands. Walker explores this changing cultural landscapeâ€“including a practice he calls â€œmurketing,â€ blending the terms murky and marketingâ€“by introducing us to the creative marketers, entrepreneurs, artists, and community organizers who have found a way to thrive within it. Using profiles of brands old and new, including Timberland, American Apparel, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Red Bull, iPod, and Livestrong, Walker demonstrates the ways in which buyers adopt products, not just as consumer choices, but as conscious expressions of their identities. Part marketing primer, part work of cultural anthropology, Buying In reveals why now, more than ever, we are what we buyâ€“and vice versa. Praise for Buying In â€œWalker â€¦ makes a startling claim: Far from being immune to advertising, as many people think, American consumers are increasingly active participants in the marketing process. â€¦ [He] leads readers through a series of lucid case studies to demonstrate that, in many cases, consumers actively participate in infusing a brand with meaning. â€¦ Convincing.â€ â€” Jay Dixit, The Washington Post â€œWalker lays out his theory in well-written, entertaining detail.â€ â€” Seth Stevenson, Slate â€œBuying In delves into the attitudes of the global consumer in the age of plenty, and, well, we arenâ€™t too pretty. Walker carries the reader on a frenetically paced tour of senseless consumption spanning from Viking ranges to custom high-tops.â€ â€” Robert Blinn, Core77 â€œRob Walker is one smart shopper.â€ â€” Jen Trolio, ReadyMade â€œThe most trenchant psychoanalyst of our consumer selves is Rob Walker. This is a fresh and fascinating exploration of the places where material culture and identity intersect.â€ â€“Michael Pollan, author of In Defense of Food â€œThis book has vast social implications, far beyond the fields of marketing and branding. It obliterates our old paradigm of companies (the bad guys) corrupting our children (the innocents) via commercials. In this new world, media-literate young people freely and willingly co-opt the brands, and most companies are clueless bystanders desperate to keep up. I really don't know if this is good news or bad news, but I can say, with certainty, that this book is a must-read.â€â€“Po Bronson, author of What Should I Do with My Life? â€œRob Walker is a gift. He shows that in our shattered, scattered world, powerful brands are existential, insinuating themselves into the human questions â€˜What am I about?â€™ and â€˜How do I connect?â€™ His insight that brand influence is becoming both more pervasive and more hiddenâ€“that we are not so self-defined as we like to thinkâ€“should make us disturbed, and vigilant.â€â€“Jim Collins, author of Good to Greatâ€œRob Walker is a terrific writerÂ who understands both human nature and the business world. His book is highly entertaining, but itâ€™s also a deeply thoughtful look at the ways in which marketing meets the modern psyche.â€â€“Bethany McLean, editor at large, Fortune, and co-author of The Smartest Guys in the Roomâ€œAre we living in an era of YouTube-empowered, brand-rejecting consumers? Rob Walker has the surprising answers, and you wonâ€™t want to miss this joyride through the front lines of consumer culture. A marketing must-read.â€â€“Chip Heath and Dan Heath, authors of Made to Stick â€œRob Walker brilliantly deconstructs the religion of consumption. Love his column, couldnâ€™t put his book down.â€â€“Paco Underhill, author of Why We Buy ...more</p>
